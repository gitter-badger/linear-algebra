\chapter{Preface}
This is a set of class notes designed to guide an inquiry-based course
      on linear algebra. This is not a complete resource! Rather, this text is
      meant to accompany the book Introduction to Linear Algebra by
      Gilbert Strang. Industrious students might also use it for a self-study
      course.
    %
\par
An important feature of this text is the integration of the Sage
      Mathematical Software System. Students in this course will learn to use
      Sage to perform long tedious computations (which linear algebra has in
      spades) and create visualizations.
    %
I thank the Sage community, in particular William Stein, for creating
      such a wonderful tool and making it open-source.
    %
\par
I also thank Rob Beezer for creating the MathBook project which makes
      this particular book project available on the web.

\typeout{Chapter 1 Vectors, the Dot Product, and Matrices}
\typeout{************************************************}
\chapter[Vectors, the Dot Product, and Matrices]{Vectors, the Dot Product, and Matrices}\label{chapter-basic-objects}

      This first chapter introduces the basic objects of linear algebra.
      You will meet vectors, the dot product, and matrices.
    %
\par

      Vectors are a generalization of the concept of number. Where real numbers
      can help us model the geometry of points on a line, vectors will allow us to
      model the geometry of a plane, or (three-dimensional) space, or even "spaces"
      with higher dimensions. We begin by learning about the algebra of vectors,
      and making connections to the geometry.
    %
\par

      The dot product is a funny kind of multiplication. It plays an important
      role in mathematics because it captures all of the basics of measurement.
      We shall learn how to use the dot product to measure lengths and angles. By
      its definition, the dot product is connected with the concept of a linear
      equation, so it will make frequent appearances in our work.
    %
\par

      Matrices are another way to generalize the concept of number. (In fact, they
      generalize the concept of vector.) We start here by learning about the
      algebra of matrices. The whole rest of this course will focus on matrices,
      their uses, and their properties.
    %
\par

      A running theme for this course is the use of the Sage mathematical software
      system. In order to get started, the fourth section of this course is
      dedicated to getting started with Sage using the SageMathCloud (SMC). You will
      make an account and run through an introductory workshop with SMC.
      Also, throughout this workbook you will find little embedded pieces of Sage
      code. These are implemented using the Sage SingleCell server. Most of these
      Sage cells are mutable. You can change the content in them and re-evaluate
      your new Sage code. I encourage you to play with these---it is a good way to
      learn the basics of Sage.
    %
\par

      The fifth and final section of the chapter is a short assignment designed to
      consolidate learning. You will get a chance to practice your skills and to
      think more deeply about the concepts you have learned.

\subsection[Some Discussion]{Some Discussion}\label{subsection-3}
Algebraically, a \terminology{vector} is a stack of numbers in a set of
     parentheses or brackets, like this\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 7 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix}, \text{ or }
          \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 7 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}, \text{ or }
          \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 & 9 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
     The individual numbers are called the \terminology{components} or \terminology{entries}
     or \terminology{coordinates} of the vector. For example, \(7\) is the second
     component of the vectors above.%
\par
The first two vectors above are called \terminology{column} vectors
        because they are stacked vertically. The third is called a \terminology{row} vector because it is arranged horizontally. For this class, we will always use column vectors, but to save space, we might sometimes write them as row vectors. It is up to you to make the switch. (We will see later how this matters!)%
\par
Vectors can take lots of different sizes. The vectors above are all \(3\)-vectors. Here is a \(2\)-vector: \[\begin{pmatrix} 71 \\ -12 \end{pmatrix}.\] Here is a \(4\)-vector: \[\begin{pmatrix} \pi \\ 0 \\ -\pi \\ 1\end{pmatrix}.\]%
\par
The main value in using vectors lies in their standard interpretations. Let's focus on \(3\)-vectors for now. The vector \(\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a \\ b \\ c\end{smallmatrix}\right)\) can represent \begin{itemize}
\item{}A point in space described in the standard three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system with \(x\) coordinate equal to \(a\), \(y\)-coordinate equal to \(b\) and \(z\) coordinate equal to \(c\).%
\item{}An arrow in space which points from the origin \((0,0,0)\) to the point \((a,b,c)\).%
\item{}An arrow in space which points from some point \((x,y,z)\) to the point \((x+a,y+b,z+c)\).%
\end{itemize}

\typeout{Subsubsection  Operations on Vectors}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[Operations on Vectors]{Operations on Vectors}\label{subsubsection-1}
There are two operations on vectors which are of utmost importance for linear algebra. (In fact, if your problem has these operations in it, there is a chance you are doing linear algebra already.)%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraph  Scalar Multiplication}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Scalar Multiplication]{Scalar Multiplication}\label{paragraph-1}
Given a number \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\) and a vector \(v = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{smallmatrix}\right)\), we form the new vector \[\lambda v = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} \lambda a \\ \lambda b \\ \lambda c \end{smallmatrix}\right).\]%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraph  Addition}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Addition]{Addition}\label{paragraph-2}
Given a vector \(v = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{smallmatrix}\right)\) and a vector \(w = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} d \\ e \\ f \end{smallmatrix}\right)\) of the same size, we form their \terminology{sum} \[ v+w = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} a+d \\ b+e \\ c+f \end{smallmatrix}\right) \]%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraph }
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[]{}\label{paragraph-3}
These operations have ``obvious'' generalizations to vectors of different sizes. Because things go entry-by-entry, these are often called \terminology{coordinate-wise} operations.%
\par
Combining these two operations gives us the notion of a \emph{linear combination}. If \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\) are numbers and \(v\) and \(w\) are vectors of a common size, then the vector \[\lambda v + \mu w \] is a linear combination of \(v\) and \(w\).%

\paragraph[Basic Constructions]{Basic Constructions}\label{paragraph-4}
A vector in Sage is constructed by applying the \verb?vector? command to a list. Lists are entered in square brackets with entries separated by commas, so the typical way to create a vector looks like this:%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
u = vector([1,1,2])
\end{lstlisting}
\par
Notice that nothing was displayed. Sage just put the vector u into memory. We can ask for it by calling it.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
u
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(1, 1, 2)
\end{lstlisting}
\par
Sage defaults to displaying vectors horizontally, which is different from how we normally write them by hand.
              This is okay. You will get used to it quickly.%
\par
Sage knows how to add, multiply by scalars, and form linear combinations, and the notation for it is just as easy as you would expect.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
v = vector([-1,-1,2])
u + v
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(0, 0, 4)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
pi * u
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(pi, pi, 2*pi)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
3*u + 4*v
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(-1, -1, 14)
\end{lstlisting}
\par
If you ask Sage to plot a vector, you get this kind of picture:%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
plot(v)
\end{lstlisting}
\par
And in two dimensions something similar...%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
a = vector([-1,1])
plot(a)
\end{lstlisting}
\par
If you find that you want a vector to have its tail someplace
              that is not the origin, use the \verb?arrow? command.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
plot(arrow([1,1],[2,3], color='red',
           arrowsize=2, width=2),
     figsize=5, aspect_ratio=1)
\end{lstlisting}
\par
Note that Sage cut off some of this plot! Also, I used some options
              just to show them off. The \verb?arrow? command works in three dimensions,
              too.
            %

\typeout{Paragraph  Interactive Demonstrations}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Interactive Demonstrations]{Interactive Demonstrations}\label{paragraph-5}
This is a Sage "interact." You can use this to explore the idea of
            linear combinations of \(2\)-vectors.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
@interact(layout= {'top':[['a','c','e'],['b','d','f'],['l','m']]})

    two_dim = arrow([0,0], [a,b], color ='red') + arrow([0,0],[c,d],color='blue')

      The dot product is a wonderful tool for encoding the geometry of Euclidean
      space, but it can be a bit mysterious at first. As Strang shows,
      it somehow holds all of the information you need to measure lengths and
      angles.
    %
\par

      What does this weird thing have to do with linear algebra? A dot product
      with a "variable vector" is a way of writing a linear equation. For example,
      \begin{gather*}
\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
        x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = 7x+3y-2z.
\end{gather*}
      Sometimes this will allow us to connect linear algebra to geometry, and use
      geometric thinking to answer algebraic questions.

\subsubsection[Basic Commands]{Basic Commands}\label{subsubsection-2}

      Sage has a built-in dot product command \verb?u.dot_product(v)?. This
      will return the dot product of the vectors \(u\) and \(v\).
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
u = vector([1,1,1]); v = vector([-1,0,1])
u.dot_product(v)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
0
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      It also has a built-in command for computing lengths. Here sage uses the
      synonym "norm": \verb?u.norm()?. Of course, you can also call this like
      a function instead of like a method: \verb?norm(u)?.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
u.norm(), v.norm()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(sqrt(3), sqrt(2))
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      There is no built-in command for angles. You just have to compute them
      using the cosine formula, like below. (I will break up the computation,
      but it is easy to do it all with one line.)
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
num = u.dot_product(v)
den = u.norm() * v.norm()
angle = arccos(num / den)
angle
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
1/2*pi
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      Of course, Sage's \verb?arccos? command returns a result in \emph{radians}.
      To switch to degrees, you must convert.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
angle*180/pi
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
90
\end{lstlisting}
\par
Often, it is helpful to normalize a vector. You can do this with the
      \verb?normalized? method like this:
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
u.normalized()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(1/3*sqrt(3), 1/3*sqrt(3), 1/3*sqrt(3))

\subsection[Discussion]{Discussion}\label{subsection-12}

      A \terminology{matrix} is a two-dimensional array of numbers like this:\[
        A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      Sometimes it helps to think of a matrix as a collection of its \terminology{rows}
      which are read across:\[
        M = \begin{pmatrix} \longrightarrow \\ \longrightarrow \end{pmatrix}
      \]
      and sometimes it helps to think of a matrix as a collection of its
      \terminology{columns} which are read down:\[
        M = \begin{pmatrix} \downarrow & \downarrow \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
    %
\par

      It is often more clear to describe a matrix by giving the sizes of its
      rows and columns. An \(m\) by \(n\) matrix is one having \(m\)
      rows and \(n\) columns. It is really easy to get these reversed, so be
      careful. For example, this is a \(2\times 3\) matrix, because it has
      two rows and three columns:\[
        B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 5 & 8 \end{pmatrix}
      \]
      A matrix is called a \terminology{square} matrix when the number of rows and
      the number of columns is equal. The matrix \(A\) that I wrote down
      above is square because it is a \(2\times 2\) matrix.
    %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  Multiplying Matrices and Vectors}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[Multiplying Matrices and Vectors]{Multiplying Matrices and Vectors}\label{subsubsection-4}

        It is possible to multiply a matrix by a vector like this:\[
          \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 5 & 8 \end{pmatrix}
          \begin{pmatrix} 13 \\ 21 \\ 34 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 102 \\ 416 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        For this to work, it is absolutely crucial that the sizes match up
        properly. If the matrix is \(m\) by \(n\), then the vector must have
        size \(n\). In the above example \(m = 2\) and \(n=3\).
      %
\par

        Later, we shall see that the word "multiplication" is not really the
        best choice here. It is better to think of the matrix as "acting on"
        the vector and turning it into a new vector. For now, the word
        multiplication will serve.
      %
\par

        How exactly does one define this matrix--vector multiplication?
      %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraph  Linear Combination of Columns Approach}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Linear Combination of Columns Approach]{Linear Combination of Columns Approach}\label{paragraph-6}

          The first way to perform the matrix-vector multiplication is to think
          of the vector as holding some coefficients for forming a linear
          combination of the columns of the matrix. In our example, it looks
          like this:\[
            \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 5 & 8 \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix} 13 \\ 21 \\ 34 \end{pmatrix} =
            13 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + 21 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 5
            \end{pmatrix} + 34 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} 102 \\ 416 \end{pmatrix}
          \]

\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraph  Dot Products with the Rows Approach}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[Dot Products with the Rows Approach]{Dot Products with the Rows Approach}\label{paragraph-7}

          The second way is to think of the matrix as a bundle of vectors lying
          along the rows of the matrix, and use the dot product. In our example
          above, this means that we consider the vectors\[
            r_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
            r_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix}, \text{ and }
            v = \begin{pmatrix} 13 \\ 21 \\ 34 \end{pmatrix}
          \]
          (notice I've rewritten the rows as columns) and then perform this
          kind of operation:\[
            \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 5 & 8 \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix} 13 \\ 21 \\ 34 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} r_1
            \\ r_2 \end{pmatrix} v =  \begin{pmatrix} r_1 \cdot v \\ r_2 \cdot
            v \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} 102 \\ 416 \end{pmatrix} .
          \]
        %
\par

      Two important remarks:
      \begin{itemize}
\item{}
          Note that these operations only make sense if the sizes match up properly.
        \item{}
          Note that the two versions of the operation give you the same results.
        \end{itemize}

\subsubsection[Matrix Equations]{Matrix Equations}\label{subsubsection-5}

        There are many situations in linear algebra that can be rewritten in
        the form of an equation that looks like this:\[
          A v = b
        \]
        where \(A\) is a matrix, and \(v\) and \(b\) are vectors. The
        interesting case is when we know \(A\) and \(b\), but we want to
        find the unknown \(v\). We will call this a
        \terminology{matrix-vector equation}.
      %
\par

        Let's consider the case where you are given some \terminology{square}
        matrix \(A\). Sometimes one can find another matrix \(B\) so that
        no matter what vector \(b\) is chosen in the matrix-vector equation
        above, the  solution vector takes the form \(v = Bb\). When this
        happens, we say that \(A\) is \terminology{invertible} and call \(B\)
        the \terminology{inverse} of \(A\). It is common to use the notation
        \(A^{-1}\) in place of \(B\). This is a wonderful situation to be
        in! Eventually, we will want to figure out some test for when a given
        matrix is invertible, and find some ways to compute the inverse.

\subsubsection[A Note about Vectors]{A Note about Vectors}\label{subsubsection-6}

        This reading also has a brief introduction to the idea of a set of
        vectors being \terminology{linearly depedent} or \terminology{linearly independent}.
        Strang is coy about the precise definition, so here it is:
      %
\par

        A set of vectors \(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\) is called \terminology{linearly
        depdendent} when there is some choice of numbers
        \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) which are not all zero so that the
        linear combination\[
          a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \dots + a_n v_n = 0
        \]
        A set of vectors which is not linearly dependent is called
        \terminology{linearly independent}.
      %
\par

        This is a little funny the first time you read it. Note that for any
        set of vectors, you can make a linear combination of those vectors
        come out as \(0\). Simply choose all of the coefficients to be
        zero. But that is so easy to do we call it \terminology{trivial}. What the
        definition is asking is that we find a \emph{nontrival linear
        combination of the vectors to make zero}.

      Sage has many useful commands for working with linear algebra, and
      given the central role played by matrices in this subject, there are
      lots of things Sage can do with matrices. We'll focus here on just basic
      construction and matrix--vector multiplication.
    %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  The matrix construction command}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[The matrix construction command]{The matrix construction command}\label{subsubsection-7}
The command to construct a matrix is pretty straightforward. One types
        \verb?matrix(r, c, [list of entries])? where \verb?r? is
        the number of rows and \verb?c? is the number of columns. The entries
        should be read across the rows starting with the top row.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A = matrix(2,3, [1,2,3,5,8,13]); A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 1  2  3]
[ 5  8 13]
\end{lstlisting}
\par
If you wish, you can structure that list of entries to be a list of lists,
        where each sublist is a row in your matrix.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B = matrix(2,3, [[1,2,3], [5,8,13]]); B
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 1  2   3]
[ 5  8  13]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

        Every once in a while, it might matter to you what kinds of numbers you
        put into the matrix. Sage will let you specify them by putting in an optional
        argument like this: \verb?matrix(number type, r, c, [list of entries])?
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
C = matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [2,1,1,1])
C # the best matrix
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[2 1]
[1 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

        The notation \verb?ZZ? means "integers." There are other sets of numbers
        here:
        \begin{itemize}
\item{}\verb?QQ? the rational numbers (with exact arithmetic)\item{}\verb?RR? the real numbers (with computer precision arithmetic)\item{}\verb?CC? the complex numbers\item{}\verb?AA? the set of all algebraic numbers, that is, all of the
            numbers that are roots of some polynomial with integer coefficients
          \end{itemize}

        You can find out what kind of entries a matrix thinks it has by calling the
        \verb?.parent()? method on it.

\subsubsection[Building a matrix from rows or columns]{Building a matrix from rows or columns}\label{subsubsection-8}

        It is possible to build a matrix by bundling together a bunch of vectors,
        too. Let's start with an example made using rows.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
v1 = vector([2,1]); v2= vector([3,4])
# construct E with rows v1 and v2, then display
E = matrix([ v1, v2]); E
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[2 1]
[3 4]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

        Sage prefers rows. I wish it were the other way, but I am sure there is
        a good reason it prefers rows. If you want to make a matrix whose columns
        are the vectors \verb?v1? and \verb?v2?, you can use the
        \verb?transpose? method. We'll talk more about the operation of transpose
        later, but it basically "switches rows for columns and vice versa."
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
F = matrix([v1,v2]).transpose(); F
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]

\end{lstlisting}
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  Matrix action on vectors}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[Matrix action on vectors]{Matrix action on vectors}\label{subsubsection-9}

        Of course, Sage knows how to perform the action of a matrix on a vector.

\end{lstlisting}
\par
And if you get the sizes wrong, it will return an error.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]

\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]

          Rewrite the above as an equation which involves a matrix.

          Plot the three vectors and describe the geometry of the situation.

          The vectors\[

          the origin). Find a normal vector to this plane.
        %
\par

          Since the vectors are linearly dependent, there must be (infinitely)

          We are interested in being able to solve this for \(x\) and \(y\)
          for any given choice of the numbers \(b_1\) and \(b_2\).
          Figure out a way to do this by writing \(x\) and \(y\) in terms

Now we take a short break to revisit and consolidate the learning you
      have done so far. Revisit the reading and the exercises you have done in
      Chapter One: Basic Objects. The important feature of this work should be
      learning to think about your own thinking. This sort of \terminology{meta-cognition}
      characterizes expert learners. Eventually, you want to be able to monitor
      your work at all times and recognize when you understand deeply and when
      you do not. This will allow you to self-correct.
    %
\par
To help you get started with meta-cognition, I listed learning goals in
      each section. To go further, you need to explicitly go through the process
      of reviewing what you can do and what you cannot. Here are some prompts to
      help you get started with this process.
      \begin{itemize}
\item{}
          Review the learning goals from each section. Can you do the things
          described? Can you do them sometimes, or have you mastered them so you
          can do them consistently?
        \item{}
          Look through all of the tasks and go deeper into them. Can you
          connect each exercise to one of our pictures? Try to build a mental
          model of how the exercise and its solution work.
        \item{}
          If your first solution to an exercise involve a ``guess-and-check''
          approach, can you now complete the exercise in a \emph{purposeful}
          and systematic manner?
        \item{}
          Make a list of concepts or exercises that are not clear to you. Phrase
          each item in your list as a question, and make each question as
          specific as possible. Talk with fellow students or your
          instructor until you can answer your own questions.

\chapter[Linear Equations]{Linear Equations}\label{chapter-2}

      This chapter is dedicated to the first major problem of
      linear algebra: solving systems of linear equations. Restated as a set of
      questions, we will consider these.
    %
\begin{itemize}
\item{}
        What is the set of solutions to a given system of linear equations?
      \item{}
        When does a given system have solution, and when does it not?
      \item{}
        If there is a solution, how many solutions are there?
      \item{}
        What ways do we have of describing the collection of solutions?
      \item{}
        Is there a computationally effective way to find those solutions?
      \end{itemize}
\par

      Though we begin with the first question, we answer the last one first. As
      we explore the process of finding solutions, we will start to build the
      tools we need to finish answering the other questions in a later chapter.
      In this chapter, we aim to get as complete understanding as we can for at
      least a special case: \terminology{square systems}.
    %
\par

      We will begin with a study of the two ways that vectors let us make pictures
      of systems of linear equations. Then we take up a basic process for finding
      solutions, where matrices will appear as a convenient notational device.
      But as we dig a little further, matrices will become interesting in their
      own way, so we will study those. But what we study will relate back to
      the fundamental issue of solving systems of linear equations.
    %

      This chapter has two short review sections in it. One just after we learn
      about elimination, and another at the end of the chapter.

      Now we have a little experience with vectors and related things, it is
      time to be aware of what we have done so we can use it as a foundation for
      future work. So far, we have talked about two geometric interpretations
      for a system of linear equations, the \terminology{row picture} and the
      \terminology{column picture}.

      each of these three views of the subject in the diagram, and also the ability
      to pass back and forth between them.

\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  The Transformational View}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[The Transformational View]{The Transformational View}\label{subsubsection-10}

        We have seen that matrices can be made to "act upon" vectors by a kind of
        multiplication. In particular, if \(A\) is an \(m\times n\) matrix,
        then \(A\) can be multiplied (on the left) with a column vector of size
        \(n\), and the result is a column vector of size \(m\).
      %
\par

        This makes \(A\) into a kind of \terminology{function}. (We will use
        the synonyms \terminology{mapping} or \terminology{transformation}, too.)
        For every vector \(v\) of size \(n\), the matrix \(A\) allows
        us to compute a new vector \(T_A(v) = Av\) of size \(m\). This is
        the basic example of what we will eventually call a \terminology{linear
        transformation}.\begin{align*}
\mathbb{R}^m & \xrightarrow[]{T_A} \mathbb{R}^n\\
v & \xmapsto[]{\phantom{T_A}} Av.
\end{align*}
        One of our long term goals is to find a way to think about the geometry
        of linear algebra from this viewpoint, too.

\typeout{Subsection  Sage and Plotting for Linear Algebra}

\subsection[Sage and Plotting for Linear Algebra]{Sage and Plotting for Linear Algebra}\label{subsection-22}
There are a few new Sage commands that might be useful here. We have
      already seen how to take linear equations and turn them into vectors
      and then turn the vector equation into a matrix equation. But Sage can
      help us move in the other direction, too.
    %
\par

      The keys are commands to pull out the rows and columns from a given matrix.
      Let's start with a simple situation where the matrix equation is
      \[
        \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
        \begin{pmatrix} x & y \end{pmatrix} =
        \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [2,1,1,1]); A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[2 1]
[1 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
x, y = var('x y')
X = vector([x,y]); X
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(x, y)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
b = vector([3,4]); b
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(3, 4)
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      To get Sage to pull out the columns, we can use the \verb?.columns()?
      method. If we want just one column, we can use the \verb?.column()? method,
      but then we have to remember to specify which column we want.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.columns() # this will return a list
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[(2, 1), (1, )]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.column(1)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(1, 1)
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      \emph{Big important note:} Sage always numbers lists starting with zero.
      so the first element of every list is the \(0\) entry, and the second
      element is the \(1\) entry.
    %
\par

      Now it is possible to make Sage do things like this:
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
column_plot = plot(A.column(0), color='red')
column_plot+= plot(A.column(1), color='blue')
column_plot+= plot(b, color='purple')
show(column_plot, figsize=5, aspect_ratio=1)
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      This is an example of the a column picture.
    %
\par

      One can also pull out the rows with corresponding row methods. And if you
      recall the way that matrix multiplication works if you think of rows, you
      can make a row picture.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.rows()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[(2, 1), (1, 1)]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
expr1 = A.row(0).dot_product(X) == b[0]
expr2 = A.row(1).dot_product(X) == b[1]

\subsection[Discussion: Elimination for Solving Systems of Linear Equations]{Discussion: Elimination for Solving Systems of Linear Equations}\label{subsection-26}

        Now we begin the process of learning how to solve a system of linear
        equations systematically through a process called \terminology{elimination}.
      %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  Some terminology}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[Some terminology]{Some terminology}\label{subsubsection-11}
A typical system looks something like this:
          \[
            \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
                  3 x_1 & +&  2 x_2 & - & \pi x_3 & = & 0 \\
                  -4 x_1 & -& 33 x_2 & + & x_3 & = & 12
                  \end{array}\right.
          \]
          This situation is \emph{two} equations in \emph{three} unknowns.
          The unknowns here are the three numbers \(x_1\), \(x_2\) and
          \(x_3\) for which we search. Usually, we bundle the numbers
          together as a vector \((x_1, x_2, x_3)\). If we can find a vector
          which makes all of the equations true simultaneously, we call that
          vector a \terminology{solution}.
        %
\par

          Keep in mind that the process involves eliminating instances of the
          variable below \terminology{pivots}. Strang describes the process
          pretty well, and gives good examples. What Strang describes in this
          section is sometimes called \terminology{the forward pass} elimination.
        %
\par

          Watch out for situations which are \terminology{singular} in that they
          have fewer pivots than unknowns. A system is called
          \terminology{non-singular} if it has as many pivots as unknowns.
        %

\subsubsection[Keeping track of things]{Keeping track of things}\label{subsubsection-12}

          Playing with all of the equations is nice, but all that really
          matters is the collection of coefficients, and the numbers on the
          right hand sides of the equal signs. Experienced solvers get tired
          of copying notation from line to line in a computation, so they only
          keep track of the matrix of coefficients, \terminology{augmented} by
          the vector on the right-hand side. In the example above, that
          augmented matrix is
          \[
            \augmatrix{ccc}{
            3 & 2 & -\pi & 0 \\ -4 & -33 & 1 & 12
            }
          \]
          All of the row operations can be performed on just this augmented
          matrix, without losing any of the essential information.
        %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection  Sage and Row Operations}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Sage and Row Operations]{Sage and Row Operations}\label{subsection-27}

        The process of elimination for systems of equations involves performing
        operations on the equations. When translated to matrix form, it involves
        operations on the rows of the coefficient matrix. The corresponding
        matrix methods come in two types.
      %
\par

        The first type of method modifies the matrix ``in place'', which means
        that it \emph{Changes the input matrix}.
      %
\begin{itemize}
\item{}\verb?A.rescale_row(r, num)? multiplies row \verb?r? by the factor of \verb?num?.\item{}\verb?A.swap_rows(r1, r2)? switches the places of rows \verb?r1? and \verb?r2?.\item{}\verb?A.add_multiple_of_row(target, useful, num)?. This adds \verb?num?
          times row \verb?useful? to row \verb?target?.\end{itemize}
\par

        Throughout, please remember that Sage uses \(0\)-based indexing! So
        the rows are labeled \verb?0, 1, 2, ...?
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A = matrix(QQ, 3,3, [0,2,4, 1,1,5, 6,2,5]); A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[0 2 4]
[1 1 5]
[6 2 5]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.swap_rows(0,1); A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 1 5]
[0 2 4]
[6 2 5]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.add_multiple_of_row(2,0,-6)
A # this should add -6 times row 0 to row 2
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[  1   1   5]
[  0   2   4]
[  0  -4 -25]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.rescale_row(1,1/2); A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[  1   1   5]
[  0   1   2]
[  0  -4 -25]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.add_multiple_of_row(2,1,4)
A # this should add 4 times row 2 to row 2

A.rescale_row(2,-1/17); A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 1 5]
[0 1 2]
[0 0 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

        This just did the whole process of \terminology{forward pass elimination}.
        (Well, we did a bit more than Strang would. He wouldn't rescale the rows.)
      %
\par

        Sometimes you do not want to change the matrix \verb?A?. If instead, you
        want to leave \verb?A? alone, you can use these methods, which return
        a new object and do not change \verb?A?.
      %
\begin{itemize}
\item{}\verb?A.with_rescaled_row(r, num)?\item{}\verb?A.with_swapped_rows(r1, r2)?\item{}\verb?A.with_added_multiple_of_row(t, u, num)?\end{itemize}
\par

        Let's do the same operations as above, but without changing \verb?A?.
        This will mean making a bunch of new matrices. In fact, let's also change
        the name of our matrix to \verb?B?
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B = matrix(QQ, 3,3, [0,2,4, 1,1,5, 6,2,5]); B
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[0 2 4]
[1 1 5]
[6 2 5]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B1 = B.with_swapped_rows(0,1); B1
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 1 5]
[0 2 4]
[6 2 5]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B2 = B1.with_added_multiple_of_row(2,0,-6)
B2 # this should add -6 times row 0 to row 2
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[  1   1   5]
[  0   2   4]
[  0  -4 -25]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B3 = B2.with_rescaled_row(1,1/2); B3
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[  1   1   5]
[  0   1   2]
[  0  -4 -25]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B4 = B3.with_added_multiple_of_row(2,1,4)
B4 # this should add 4 times row 2 to row 2
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[  1   1   5]
[  0   1   2]
[  0   0 -17]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B5 = B4.with_rescaled_row(2,-1/17); B5
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 1 5]
[0 1 2]
[0 0 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

        This second option has some advantages. At any point, you can revise your
        work, because the original matrix is still in memory, and so are all of
        the intermediate steps. Let's display all six of the matrices at once to
        see that they all still exist.

\typeout{Subsubsection  The Four Ways to Write a System}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[The Four Ways to Write a System]{The Four Ways to Write a System}\label{subsubsection-13}

        Recall that there are three equivalent ways to write the typical linear
        algebra problem: (1) a system of linear equations to be solved
        simultaneously, (2) an equation expressing some linear combination of
        vectors with unknown coefficients as equal to another vector, and (3) a
        matrix equation.
      %
\par

        Here is an example: This system of linear equations
        \[
          \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
              &  &3y &+ &2z &= &8 \\
            x &- & y &+ & z &= &-1 \\
          3 x &+ &2y &+ &3z &= &1
          \end{array}\right.
        \]
        is equivalent to this equation using a linear combination of vectors
        \[
        x \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} +
        y \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} +
        z \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} =
        \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        and both of those are equivalent to this matrix equation
        \[
          \begin{pmatrix} 0 &3 &2 \\ 1 &-1 &1 \\ 3 &2 &3
          \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} .
        \]
      %
\par

        Each of these viewpoints has its advantages when talking about the
        geometry of linear algebra. But one way that things steadily improve as
        you move down the page is in the amount of notational baggage.
        From each version to the next, we lose repetitive bits of symbol that
        one can just remember from context.
        Often, this is taken one step further! We now throw away the unknowns,
        the equal signs and some of the parentheses surrounding the matrices and
        vectors, and just write an \emph{augmented} matrix.
        \[
          \augmatrix{ccc}{
          0 &3 &2 &8\\ 1 &-1 &1 &-1\\ 3 &2 &3 &1
          }
        \]
        This is the minimum fuss way to keep track of all the information you
        need to solve the original system.

\subsubsection[Representing Elimination with Matrices]{Representing Elimination with Matrices}\label{subsubsection-14}

        The process of elimination starts by performing operations on the
        system of equations. In the example above, one simplification we can
        make is to add \(-3\) times equation (ii) to equation (iii).
      %
\par

        Then the new system looks like this:
        \[
          \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
          &  &3y &+ &2z &= &8 \\
          x &- & y &+ & z &= &-1 \\
          &  &5y &  &   &= &4
          \end{array}\right.
        \]
        Let's translate that into the linear combination format:
        \[
          x \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} +
          y \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} +
          z \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} .
        \]
        What has happened to each of the vectors? Well, in each case, we have
        added \(-3\) times the second component to the third component.
        We have seen that one way to change vectors into other vectors is by
        (left-)multiplying them by matrices. Could we be so lucky that the
        operation ``add \(-3\) times the second component to the third
        component'' is representable by a matrix operation? YES. It is not
        hard to check that the matrix we need is
        \[
          E = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\ 0 &-3 &1 \end{pmatrix} .
        \]
        In fact, let's check it now for each of the four vectors we have in our system:
        \[
          E \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\
          0 &-3 &1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
          = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        and
        \[
          E \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\ 0 &-3
          &1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        and
        \[
          E \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\
          0 &-3 &1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3
          \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        and
        \[
          E \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\
          0 &-3 &1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
        \]
      %
\par

        Ha Ha! It all checks out. Those are the four vectors from our second
        system. This means that we can even use a simple subsitution to rewrite
        things. (It is not obvious at the moment why this is helpful. Hang on a
        bit.)
        \[
          x* E\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} +
          y* E\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} +
          z* E\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} =
          E\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        Boy, it sure would be nice if we had a compact way to write that down...
      %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  Matrix Multiplication}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[Matrix Multiplication]{Matrix Multiplication}\label{subsubsection-15}

        We make a compact way to write down that last equation by defining an
        operation of multiplying two matrices.
        If \(E\) and \(A\) are two matrices, we define their
        \terminology{matrix product}
        to be a new matrix as follows:
      %
\par

        First, write \(A\) as a collection of columns \(v_i\)
        \[
          A = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 &v_2 &v_3 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        and then we declare that \(EA\) is the matrix made up of the columns
        \(Ev_i\) in the corresponding order.
        \[
          EA = \begin{pmatrix} Ev_1 &Ev_2 &Ev_3 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
      %
\par

        By way of example, we have already considered the matrices
        \[
          E = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\ 0 &-3 &1 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{ and } \quad
          A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &3 &2 \\ 1 &-1 &1 \\ 3 &2 &3 \end{pmatrix}.
        \]
        You should check that their product is now
        \[
          EA = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &0 &0 \\ 0 &1 &0 \\ 0 &-3 &1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 &3 &2 \\ 1 &-1 &1 \\ 3 &2 &3 \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 0 &3 &2 \\ 1 &-1 &1 \\ 0 &5 &0 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
      %
\par

        Finally, let's see how this influences our last two forms of the equations.
        The matrix form of our system was \(Ax = v\) where \(A\) is as above, and the
        vectors are \(v = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 1
        \end{smallmatrix}\right)\) and
        \(x = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{smallmatrix}\right)\).
        The neat part is that our new definition of matrix multiplication means
        that our elimination step transformed the equation
        \[
          Ax = v \quad \text{ or }\quad
          \begin{pmatrix} 0 &3 &2 \\ 1 &-1 &1 \\ 3 &2 &3
          \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =
          \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        into the newer equation
        \[
          (EA) x = Ev \quad \text{ or } \quad \begin{pmatrix} 0 &3 &2
          \\ 1 &-1 &1 \\ 0 &5 &0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x
          \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
        \]
      %
\par

        The same thing works for the augmented matrix. The augmented matrix form
        is really just writing down
        \[
          \augmatrix{c}{A &v }
          =\augmatrix{ccc}{
          0 &3 &2 &8\\ 1 &-1 &1 &-1\\ 3 &2 &3 &1 }
        \]
        and the elimination step changes this into
        \[
          \augmatrix{c}{EA &Ev}
          = \augmatrix{ccc}{
          0 &3 &2 &8 \\ 1 &-1 &1 &-1 \\ 0 &5 &0 &4
          }.
        \]
      %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  Matrices as Transformations}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[Matrices as Transformations]{Matrices as Transformations}\label{subsubsection-16}

        Take a moment and reflect on the key transition in what happens above.
        The most important thing that made it all work was that a matrix (the
        elimination matrix \(E\)) was used to perform some sort of operation on
        vectors.
      %
\par

        This is a key property of matrices. The matrix \(E\) defines a kind of
        function. For every vector \(w\) with three components, we can compute
        exactly one new vector \(Ew\), still with three components. This means that
        \(E\) defines a function from the set of \(3\)-vectors to the set of
        \(3\)-vectors.
      %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection  Sage and Matrix Multiplication}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[Sage and Matrix Multiplication]{Sage and Matrix Multiplication}\label{subsection-32}

      Sage has built-in matrix multiplication. You do the obvious thing and it
      works.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [[2,1],[1,1]])
B = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [[0,3],[1,1]])
A, B
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(
[2 1]  [0 3]
[1 1], [1 1]
)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A*B
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      You can check that it works with the way we defined matrix multiplication
      as a linear combination of vectors, too.
    %
\par

      First, we define the column vectors by pulling out the entries from \verb?B?
      and arranging them. To be sure, we ask Sage to display them as columns.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
b1 = vector([B[0,0], B[1,0]])
b2 = vector([B[0,1], B[1,1]])
b1.column(), b2.column()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(
[0]  [3]
[1], [1]
)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A*b1.column(), A*b2.column()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(
[1]  [7]
[1], [4]
)
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      Now we can pile these rows into a matrix and then use the transpose to
      put them in columns.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
C = matrix([A*b1, A*b2]).transpose()
C
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 7]
[1 4]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      And we can double check everything by asking Sage if these things are equal.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
C == A*B
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
True
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      This kind of test can be useful for checking our work! The discussion above
      has this multiplication:
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
D = matrix(QQ,3,4, [0,3,2,8,1,-1,1,-1,3,2,3,1]); D
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 0  3  2  8]
[ 1 -1  1 -1]
[ 3  2  3  1]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
E = matrix.identity(3)
E[2,1] = -3
E
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 1  0  0]
[ 0  1  0]
[ 0 -3  1]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
E*D
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 0  3  2  8]
[ 1 -1  1 -1]
[ 0  5  0  4]
\end{lstlisting}

Now we take a short break to revisit and consolidate the learning you

      Chapter One: Basic Objects. The important feature of this work should be
      learning to think about your own thinking. This sort of \terminology{meta-cognition}

To help you get started with meta-cognition, I listed learning goals in

      help you get started with this process.
      \begin{itemize}
\item{}
          Review the learning goals from each section. Can you do the things

          can do them consistently?
        \item{}
          Look through all of the tasks and go deeper into them. Can you
          connect each exercise to one of our pictures? Try to build a mental
          model of how the exercise and its solution work.
        \item{}
          If your first solution to an exercise involve a ``guess-and-check''
          approach, can you now complete the exercise in a \emph{purposeful}
          and systematic manner?
        \item{}
          Make a list of concepts or exercises that are not clear to you. Phrase
          each item in your list as a question, and make each question as
          specific as possible. Talk with fellow students or your
          instructor until you can answer your own questions.

\subsection[Discussion on Matrix Algebra]{Discussion on Matrix Algebra}\label{subsection-38}

      At the simplest level, this section is just about how to deal with the
      basic operations on matrices. We can add them and we can multiply them.
      We have already encountered matrix multiplication, and addition is even
      more natural.
    %
\par

      But a subtle and important thing is happening here. Matrices are taking
      on a life of their own. They are becoming first class objects, whose
      properties are interesting and possibly useful.
    %
\par

      This is an instance of the beginnings of \emph{Modern Algebra}, which
      is the study of the algebraic structures of abstracted objects. In this
      case, we study whole collections of matrices of a common shape, and we
      try to treat them like generalized numbers. Then the natural questions
      are how much like ``regular numbers'' are these matrices?
    %
\par

      Addition is about as well-behaved as you can expect, but multiplication
      is a bit trickier. Suddenly, two properties of multiplication for numbers
      don't quite work for matrices:
    %
\begin{itemize}
\item{}multiplication does not necessarily commute: It need not be the case
        that \(AB\) is the same as \(BA\).
      \item{}we may not always have inverses: just because there is a
        matrix \(A\) which is not the zero matrix, it may not be the case
        that we can make sense of \(A^{-1}\) and get \(AA^{-1} = I\).

      Sage is aware of the basic matrix operations, and it won't let you get

      defined if the dimensions of the matrices line up properly.

Matrix addition works a lot like addition of integers, as long as you fix
        a size first.%
\begin{itemize}
\item{}There is a zero element.\item{}There are additive inverses (i.e. \emph{negatives}).\item{}The operation is commutative.\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
#This constructs the zero matrix
Z = zero_matrix(2,3); Z
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
\end{lstlisting}

Let us add \verb?A? and \verb?Z?:%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A + Z
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[0 1 2]
[3 6 6]
\end{lstlisting}
\par
We can check that adding \verb?Z? doesn't change anything.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A + Z == A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
True
\end{lstlisting}
\par
And we can do the natural thing to get an additive inverse.%

L = -A; L
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 0 -1 -2]
[-3 -6 -6]

\subsubsection[Sage and Matrix Multiplication]{Sage and Matrix Multiplication}\label{subsubsection-18}

        Sage already has the structure of matrix multiplication built-in, and
        it can help with investigating the ways that matrix multiplicaiton
        is different from regular multiplication of numbers.
      %
\par

        We have seen above
        that Sage will not let us multiply matrices whose sizes do not match
        correctly.  Of course, one way around that trouble is to stick to square
        matrices. But even there we can have trouble with the fact that matrix
        multiplication might not commute. It is rarely the case that \(XY = YX\).
      %
\par

        For those of you who will eventually study Modern Algebra, the collection
        of all \(n\)-square matrices is an example of a non-commutative ring
        with unit.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A*E, E*A
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(
         [12 27 30]
[14  7]  [15 32 34]
[57 48], [ 3 12 18]
)
\end{lstlisting}
\par
Sage knows about the ring structure. We can check for an inverse.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B.is_invertible()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
True
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
C.is_invertible()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
False
\end{lstlisting}
\par
And we can ask for the inverse in a couple of ways.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B.inverse()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[-1/2   1]
[ 3/2  -2]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B^(-1)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[-1/2   1]
[ 3/2  -2]
\end{lstlisting}
\par
One can even construct the whole ring of all \(n\times n\) matrices
      and play around inside it.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
M = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2,2); M
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
\end{lstlisting}
\par
It is then not too hard to construct the identity element, which is
        the regular identity matrix of the correct size.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
M(1)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 0]
[0 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par
Also, the zero matrix of the correct size is easy to make.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
M(0)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[0 0]
[0 0]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

        In fact, this allows you to short cut the construction of any matrix in
        \verb?M?. This can be really useful if you are going to work with a lot
        of matrices of the same shape.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
H = M([2,1,1,1]); H
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[2 1]
[1 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par
You can even use this to make complicated expressions out of matrix operations.
        As long as everything makes sense, Sage will do all the work.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
H^2 + H
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
# this one should turn out to be zero.
# I know this because of a theorem.

\subsubsection[Sage and Block Matrices]{Sage and Block Matrices}\label{subsubsection-19}
Sage has a built-in method for constructing matrices out of blocks, too.
        It is easiest to see an example.
      %
\par

        To make this work, you have to tell Sage when you have a vector if you
        want it to be either a row or a column vector in the appropriate places.
      %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]

        Make an example of a \(2\times 3\) matrix and a \(3\times 3\)
        matrix, and use this to demonstrate the three different ways to multiply
        matrices.
      \end{task}
\begin{task}
\label{task-56}

        Give an example of a pair of \(2\times 2\) matrices \(A\) and
        \(B\) so that \(AB = 0\) but \(BA\neq 0\), or explain why
        this is  impossible.
      \end{task}
\begin{task}
\label{task-57}

        Give an example of a \(3\times 3\) matrix \(A\) such that neither
        \(A\) nor \(A^2\) is the zero matrix, but \(A^3=0\).

        Find all examples of matrices \(A\) which commute with both
        \(B = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0
          \end{smallmatrix}\right)\) and
        \(C = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0
          \end{smallmatrix}\right)\). That is, find all matrices \(A\)
        so that \(AB = BA\) and \(AC= CA\). How do you know you have
        all such matrices?
      \end{task}
\begin{task}
\label{task-59}

          Consider the matrix
          \[
            A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ -2 & 0 & 1 \\ 8 & 5 & 3 \end{pmatrix}.
          \]
          Which elimination matrices \(E_{21}\) and \(E_{31}\) produce zeros in the
          \((2,1)\) and \((3,1)\) positions of \(E_{21}A\)
          and \(E_{31}A\)?
        %
\par

          Find a single matrix \(E\) which produces both zeros at once.
          Multiply \(EA\) to verify your result.
        %
\end{task}
\begin{task}
\label{task-60}

          Let's take a different view of the last computation.
          Block multiplication says that column 1 is eliminated by
          a step that looks like this one:
          \[
            EA = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ -c/a & I \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & D \end{pmatrix} =
            \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & D - cb/a \end{pmatrix}.
          \]
          Here \(I\) is the \(2\times 2\) identity matrix, \(D\) is a
          \(2\times 2\) matrix, etc.
        %
\par

          So, in the last exercise, what are \(a\), \(b\), \(c\)
          and \(D\) and what
          is \(D-cb/a\)? Be sure to describe what shape each matrix has: the
          number of rows and columns.
        %
\end{task}
\begin{task}
\label{task-61}

        Suppose that we have already solved the equation \(Ax=b\) for the
        following three special choices of \(b\):
        \[
          Ax_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \text{ , } Ax_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \text{, and } Ax_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
        \]
        If the three solutions are called \(x_1\), \(x_2\) and \(x_3\)
        and then bundled together to make the columns of a matrix
        \[X =  \begin{pmatrix} | & | & | \\
          x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\ | & | & |
          \end{pmatrix},
        \] what is the matrix \(AX\)? What does this mean about \(X\)?

        The main point of this section is to start focusing on the first big
        problem in linear algebra. How can you tell, in advance, that a system
        of \(n\) equations in \(n\) unknowns will have a solution?
      %
\par

        Of course, like all things we have been studying, this will have several
        different faces, all of which are equivalent. The one front and center
        right now is this: When does an \(n \times n\) square matrix have an inverse?
      %
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsubsection  Finding an Inverse: Gauss-Jordan Elimination}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsubsection[Finding an Inverse: Gauss-Jordan Elimination]{Finding an Inverse: Gauss-Jordan Elimination}\label{subsubsection-21}

        There is an effective method for finding the inverse, and it is
        Gauss-Jordan elimination. (This is sometimes just called
        \emph{Gaussian elimination}.) Essentially, you wish to solve \(n\)
        different systems \(Ax= b\) of size \(n\times n\) all at the same
        time, with specially chosen right hand sides.
      %
\par

        The process is an algorithm, so it is very specific. If you do this some
        other way, you aren't doing Gauss-Jordan Elimination. The name is applied
        to the process.
      %
\par

        \emph{Gauss-Jordan Elimination}
      %
\begin{itemize}
\item{}
          \emph{Augment:} Tack on a copy of the identity matrix of the same
          size to the right hand side of your matrix. It should now look like
          \((A \mid I)\).
        \item{}
          \emph{Forward Pass:} This is a nested procedure:
          \begin{itemize}
\item{}
              \emph{preparation:} If necessary, use a row swap to make a
              non-zero entry in the upper left entry.
            \item{}
              \emph{make zeros:} The upper left entry is our first pivot. Use
              the operation of adding a multiple of the first row to the other
              rows to kill the entries below this first pivot.
            \item{}
              \emph{step down:} Step down to the second row and repeat the
              above, but ignoring rows and columns above and to the left. Repeat
              as necessary till you run out of rows.
            \end{itemize}

          If at any point in the process you get a row consisting of only zeros,
          perform a row switch to suffle it to the bottom. When the forward
          pass is complete, you should have an upper triangular matrix.
        \item{}
          \emph{Backward Pass:} This is also nested, like the forward pass,
          except that instead of working down and to the right, you begin at
          the lower right with the last pivot and work up and to the left.
          When complete, the matrix should have at most one non-zero entry in
          each row. This entry will be a pivot.
        \item{}
          \emph{Rescale:} rescale rows to make the pivots into \(1\)'s.
        \end{itemize}
\par

        At the end of the whole process, you should have something that looks
        like this: \((I \mid B)\). The wonderful part: \(B\) is the
        inverse of \(A\). Well, almost. The process can fail! If along the
        line you find that the left hand block of your big augmented matrix
        doesn't have \(n\) pivots in it, then your matrix was not invertible.
      %
\par

        What you have computed in the left hand block with the Gauss-Jordan
        elimination is the \emph{reduced row-echelon form} of your original matrix.

\subsubsection[The Big Theorem: invertibility, singularity, and the determinant]{The Big Theorem: invertibility, singularity, and the determinant}\label{subsubsection-22}

        What is the key?
      %
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem-1}

          An \(n\times n\) matrix \(A\) is invertible exactly when it has
          \(n\) pivots. Equivalently, its reduced row-echelon form has \(n\)
          non-zero entries down the diagonal. The inverse will be computed by
          Gauss-Jordan elimination.
        \end{theorem}
\par

        This is huge. The algorithm is not difficult, and it answers an
        important question exactly.
      %
\par

        Note that we said a square matrix was \emph{singular} when it did not
        have enough pivots. So what the above says is that a matrix is invertible
        if and only if it is non-singular.

\subsubsection[A simple test]{A simple test}\label{subsubsection-23}

        We can use the above to make a simple numerical test of when a matrix is
        invertible. First do the forward pass of elimination to obtain an upper
        triangular matrix. Take the product of the diagonal entries. This will
        be zero if and only if one of the diagonal entries is zero, which will
        only happen if there are fewer than \(n\) pivots. This product is then
        helpful enough to test for invertibility, and so it deserves its own
        name: the \terminology{determinant}. We shall learn more about this quantity later.

\subsection[Sage and Gauss-Jordan Elimination]{Sage and Gauss-Jordan Elimination}\label{subsection-44}

      We have already seen that Sage has commands for constructing matrices and
      performing row operations. Those are the operations used to perform
      Gauss-Jordan Elimination. But there are several interesting and useful
      commands in this neighborhood we have not yet discussed.
    %
\par

      Let us construct my favorite matrix so we have something to play with.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [2,1,1,1])
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      We can use the \verb?.is_invertible()? method to check that \verb?A? is
      invertible. In general, this method returns \verb?True? or \verb?False?.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.is_invertible()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
True
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      And we can get Sage to just compute the inverse for us.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.inverse()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 1 -1]
[-1  2]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      Just so we can see what happens if the matrix is not invertible, we try
      another matrix.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B = matrix(QQ, 2,2, [0,1,0,0])
B.is_invertible()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
False
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
B.inverse()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
Error in lines 1-1
...
ZeroDivisionError: input matrix must be nonsingular
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      We can also ask Sage to compute determinants with the \verb?.determinant()?
      method.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.determinant(), B.determinant()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
(1,0)
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      Sage is also capable of computing the reduced row echelon form
      (the ``rref'') of a matrix with the appropriately named \verb?.rref()?
      method.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.rref()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 0]
[0 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      The method \verb?.rref()? does not change the matrix \verb?A?. There is
      another command which will work the same way for our purposes,
      \verb?.echelon_form()?.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
A.echelon_form()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 0]
[0 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      There is a related command which \emph{will find the rref and then update the
      matrix}. It is called \verb?.echelonize()?.
      Because I don't really want to mess with \verb?A?, we will
      make a copy first.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
C = copy(A) # fancy Python trick! (not so fancy)
C.echelonize()
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      Now we ask sage to print those out for us.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
print A
print '\n'
print C
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
        [2 1]
        [1 1]

        [1 0]
        [0 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      Now, we can be just a bit more hands-on with Gauss-Jordan elimination
      if we do it this way. We will combine commands we have used before to
      do this.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
M = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2,2)
M(1) # this is the 2x2 identity
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[1 0]
[0 1]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      Now we do the algorithm.
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
D = A.augment(M(1))
D.rref()
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 1  0  1 -1]
[ 0  1 -1  2]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      That was good. But we only need the right-hand submatrix. We can get Sage
      to report just that!
    %
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
E = D.rref().matrix_from_columns([2,3]); E
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageoutput]
[ 1 -1]
[-1  2]
\end{lstlisting}
\par

      It is often convenient to chain methods together like this. Then you can
      read what happens from left to right.

        Suppose that for the matrix \(D\) in the last exercise we imagine solving the matrix
        equation \(Dx = b\) for some vector \(b\) of the appropriate size. What might one mean
        by the row picture in this case? What might the column picture mean?
      \end{task}
\begin{task}
\label{task-68}

        Design a \(6 \times 6\) matrix which has the following properties:
        \begin{itemize}
\item{} no entry equal to zero\item{} the reduced row echelon form should have exactly 5 pivots\item{} the 5 pivots should be different numbers\item{} no pair of rows should be scalar multiples of one another\end{itemize}

        Is your matrix invertible? How do you know? Does Sage say it is invertible?
