    <p>This is a set of class notes designed to guide an inquiry-based course
      on linear algebra. This is not a complete resource! Rather, this text is
      meant to accompany the book <emph>Introduction to Linear Algebra</emph> by
      Gilbert Strang. Industrious students might also use it for a self-study
      course.
    </p>
    <p>An important feature of this text is the integration of the Sage
      Mathematical Software System. Students in this course will learn to use
      Sage to perform long tedious computations (which linear algebra has in
      spades) and create visualizations.
    </p>

  <acknowledgement>
    <p>I thank the Sage community, in particular William Stein, for creating
      such a wonderful tool and making it open-source.
    </p>
    <p>I also thank Rob Beezer for creating the MathBook project which makes
      this particular project available on the web.

      <p>TJ Hitchman is something clever and not-at-all-self-referential in this
        space here.
