  <title>Three Geometric Models</title>

  <subsection>
    <title>The Assignment</title>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Read section 2.1 of <em>Strang</em> (pages 31-40).
      </li>
      <li>
        Read the following and complete the exercises below
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Learning Goals</title>
  </subsection>
  <p>
    Before class, a student should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Translate back and forth between the three algebraic representations:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A system of linear equations.
        </li>
        <li>
          An equation involving a linear combination of vectors.
        </li>
        <li>
          A matrix equation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Can write down the <m>n \times n</m> <term>identity matrix</term>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Sometime in the near future, a student should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Given a system, interpret and plot the <q>row picture</q>.</li>
    <li>Given a system, interpret and plot the <q>column picture</q>.</li>
    <li>Use a matrix as a model of a <term>transformation</term>, including stating
      the <term>domain</term> and the <term>range</term>.</li>
  </ul>


  <subsection>
    <title>Discussion</title>

    <p>
      Now we have a little experience with vectors and related things, it is
      time to be aware of what we have done so we can use it as a foundation for
      future work. So far, we have talked about two geometric interpretations
      for a system of linear equations, the <term>row picture</term> and the
      <term>column picture</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the following picture make sense to you?
    </p>
    <figure>
      <caption>The three geometric models of linear algebra</caption>
      <image width="350" source="images/ThreePics.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      A deep understanding of linear algebra will involve a level of comfort with
      each of these three views of the subject in the diagram, and also the ability
      to pass back and forth between them.
    </p>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>The Transformational View</title>

      <p>
        We have seen that matrices can be made to "act upon" vectors by a kind of
        multiplication. In particular, if <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix,
        then <m>A</m> can be multiplied (on the left) with a column vector of size
        <m>n</m>, and the result is a column vector of size <m>m</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes <m>A</m> into a kind of <term>function</term>. (We will use
        the synonyms <term>mapping</term> or <term>transformation</term>, too.)
        For every vector <m>v</m> of size <m>n</m>, the matrix <m>A</m> allows
        us to compute a new vector <m>T_A(v) = Av</m> of size <m>m</m>. This is
        the basic example of what we will eventually call a <term>linear
        transformation</term>.<md>
        <mrow>\mathbb{R}^m &amp; \xrightarrow[]{T_A} \mathbb{R}^n</mrow>
        <mrow>v &amp; \xmapsto[]{\phantom{T_A}} Av.</mrow></md>
        One of our long term goals is to find a way to think about the geometry
        of linear algebra from this viewpoint, too.
