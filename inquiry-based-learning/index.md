I conduct each of my classes in some sort of Inquiry Based Learning format.
Essentially, this means that I strive for an active, student-centered
environment. Lectures will be infrequent (if they happen at all), and instead
students will engage in activities that have them participate as working
mathematicians by conducting research at an appropriate level. It is important
to note two fundamental differences between how Inquiry Based classes operate
and traditional lecture classes do:

1. Students will be responsible for producing mathematical understanding. They
  must grapple with the material and construct their own arguments for why
  things are as they appear to be.
2. Students will be the arbiters of correctness in the classroom. The
  instructor’s role is to guide discussion and set the parameters for student
  inquiry. But the students are the ones who say whether a particular argument
  is correct or not—students must take ownership of the mathematics being
  developed.

If you have not experienced an inquiry based learning environment before, this
can be a bit unsettling. Have no fear! It is my job as the instructor to put you
in a position to have success, and to help guide you back toward success when
you miss the mark. Pretty soon, you will be much more comfortable.

## Why are we doing this?

It is my goal to help you increase your power and ability as a mathematician.
Since I want you to help you improve at doing mathematics, I have structured
our class as an environment where you must do mathematics. This gives you
opportunity to practice and grow, and it gives me an opportunity to see what
you are capable of doing and where I can help you the most.
