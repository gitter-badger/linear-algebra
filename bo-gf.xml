  <title>Going Further with the Basic Objects</title>


  <subsection>
    <title>The Assignment</title>

    <p>Now we take a short break to revisit and consolidate the learning you
      have done so far. Revisit the reading and the exercises you have done in
      Chapter One: Basic Objects.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Review the learning goals from each section. Can you do the things
          described? Can you do them sometimes, or have you mastered them so you
          can do them consistently?
        </li>
        <li>
          Go back through the exercises in this workbook. Complete any items you
          did not complete the first time through. Prepare any that we have not
          discussed in class so that you will be ready to present them.
        </li>
        <li>
          As you look through all of the tasks, go deeper into them. Can you
          connect each exercise to one of our pictures? Try to build a mental
          model of how the exercise and its solution work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a list of concepts or exercises that are not clear to you. Phrase
          each item in your list as a question, and make each question as
          specific as possible. Talk with fellow students or your
          instructor until you can answer your own questions.
        </li>
      </ul>
