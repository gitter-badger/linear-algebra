<preface>

<p>This is a set of class notes written to guide new an inquiry-based course on linear algebra. This is not a complete resource! Rather, this is meant to accompany the book by Gilbert Strang.</p>

<p>It is important to use Sage. It is important to write a complete paragraph. Also, we want to learn how to read, how to code, how to write, and how to figure stuff out for ourselves.</p>
