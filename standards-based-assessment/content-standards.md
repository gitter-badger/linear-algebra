title: Content Standards
---

The basic content standards for linear algebra are divided into _foundational_
proficiencies, which are mostly computational, and _advanced_ proficiencies,
which are about building good mental models and developing context and deeper
meaning for the structure of linear algebra.

    <h3>Foundational</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Add vectors</li>
      <li>Multiply a vector by a scalar</li>
      <li>compute linear combinations</li>
      <li>draw pictures which correspond to the three above operaitons.</li>
      <li>Compute the dot product of two given vectors.</li>
      <li>Compoute the length of a given vector.</li>
      <li>Normalize a given vector</li>
      <li>recognize that \( u\cdot v = 0 \) is the same as "\(u\) and \(v\)
        are orthogonal."</li>
      <li>compute the angle between two given vectors using the cosine formula.</li>
      <li>Multiply a matrix times a vector as a linear combination of columns.</li>
      <li>Multiply a matrix times a vector as a set of dot products, row times
      column.</li>
      <li>Translate back and forth between our three algebraic representations:
      systems of linear equations, linear combination equations, and matrix
      equations.</li>
      <li>correctly identify the rows and columns of a matrix.</li>
      <li>describe waht is meant by a lower triangular matrix.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="col-xs-12 sm-6">
    <h3>Advanced</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Solve linear combination equations involving unknown coefficients.</li>
      <li>Solve linear combination equations involving unknown vectors.</li>
      <li>Interpret the statements \(u \cdot v &lt; 0\) and  \(u \cdot v > 0\)
        geometrically.</li>
      <li>Pass back and forth between linear equations and equations involving
      dot products.</li>
      <li>Make pictures of level sets of the dot product operation.</li>
      <li>Desribe what it means for vectors in the plane or in space to be
      linearly dependent or linearly independent.</li>
      <li>Describe what the inverse of a matrix is, and its significance.</li>
    </ul>
