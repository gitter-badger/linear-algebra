  <title>Getting Started with Sage</title>

  <subsection>
    <title>The Assignment</title>

    <p>It it is time to get comfortable with the basics of using Sage. Begin by
      setting up an account with SageMathCloud.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Be sure that you have login access to computers in student labs across
          campus. Before class, drop by a campus lab and make sure your credentials
          work properly and you can sign in to a machine. For our tutorial session
          we will use WRT 110, so that would be a good choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Go to the course web site and follow the links to the Sage Intro
          workshop.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Complete the first two steps of the workshop set up process:
          <ol>
            <li>Start: where you make an account at SageMathCloud.</li>
            <li>Get: where you create your first "project" and populate it with
              files for a tutorial.</li>
          </ol></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <subsection>
        <title>Learning Objectives</title>

        <p>At the end of this assignment, a student should have an account at
          SageMathCloud and should be able to log into the service without trouble.
          The student will also have a first project with some files.</p>
