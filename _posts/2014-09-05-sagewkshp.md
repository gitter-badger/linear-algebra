Today we worked through the basic [Sage Introductory Workshop][sagewkshp]. If for
some reason you missed class, or if you were unable to complete the whole workshop
during our lab session, please complete it on your own time.

From now on, I will assume that you have access to Sage for working on this class.
This means that I may assign some tasks that are easier to complete if you have
Sage as a tool, and I may assign some tasks that explicitly ask you to use Sage.
Also, sage cells will be sprinkled liberally throughout the workbook.

I am very happy to help you get more comfortable with Sage, and the
SageMathCloud service we used in class. If you feel stuck on something, just ask
me for help. Email is probably the best way to reach me for this. It can be
helpful in some instances to use the chat/hangout features of our UNI Google
email accounts, or the sharing and chat features in SMC.

Eventually you will feel more comfortable with Sage and you will be ready to
take the [**Technology Assessment**][tech-assess]. Let me know when you wish to
do this and we will schedule a meeting.

Of course, for a quick computation, don't forget about the existence of the Sage
[SingleCell server][sage-single-cell]. It is much more convenient for a simple
thing, since it does not require a log-in. It doesn't have the same help features,
though, so there is a trade-off to be made.
