Today's discussion included a brief introduction to the idea of a permutation matrix,
the idea of the transpose operation, and how we can represent the process of
the forward pass elimination steps using left-multiplication by matrices.

We also talked a little about using Sage, and
[the history of my favorite matrix.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold's_cat_map)

You all had an exasperated, unfriendly look about you. I suspect that it is because
I made you *really* start using the computer. Time to buck up. You can do it. And
I expect you to do it. I will even help you learn how to do it if you ask. I think
of myself as a helpful man.

Here is what we did discuss in class:

  * \#2.17 Bostian
  * \#2.18 Schulte
  * \#2.19 Ratz
  * \#2.20 Burken

  As I see it, the remaining items for us to discuss in our next meeting are these:
  From Chapter 2, Tasks 6, 9, 10, 11, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24
