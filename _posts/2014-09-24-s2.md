Today was our chance to talk about the \\(LU\\) decomposition for the first time.
This is a neat way in which the Gaussian Elimination process gives us a _factorization_
of a matrix.

I was glad we got a chance to talk about how this works. We also got a chance to
polish our "GJE skills" a little bit. Remember to work the process following the
recipe, and the \\(LU\\) decomposition will fall into your lap.

A run-down of today's presenters:

  * \#2.39 Kalishek
  * \#2.40 TJH
  * \#2.41 Teske
  * \#2.42 Van Nevele
  * \#2.43 Van Nevele
  * \#2.44 class work in small groups
  * \#2.45 Nogueira

Your next reading is about _permutation matrices_ and how they help us patch up
the \\(LU\\) decomposition in those situations where you absolutely cannot
avoid a row swap operation during Gaussian Elimination.
