Today we completed discussion of all of the unaddressed items from chapter 1. This
led to some good discussion on what counts as a proof, and how to use the row and
column pictures, and how the idea of an inverse matrix pops up from solving a system
carefully.

I have in my notes the following presenters.

* \# 11 Sorensen
* \# 12 Banker
* \# 21 Ratz
* \# 22 Bostian
* \# 29 McGee
* \# 30 Nelson

And I did not collect the daily homework, because my instructions were not as
clear as they should have been. In the future, for our extra days, please prepare
the items we have not yet discussed as your daily assignment.
