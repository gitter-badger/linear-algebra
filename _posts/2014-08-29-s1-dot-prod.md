I am glad we had a chance today to do these things:

1. See some Sage interacts. Go play with those. (When I get them into the book.)
2. Continue connecting the algebra of linear equations to different types of geometric
   pictures. This will be important for building mental models and thinking deeply.

A quick run-down of what we got through:

* \#13. Bostian, then Nelson
* \#14. Spurgeon
* \#15. Reinard
* \#16. Kos
* \#17. Becker
* \#18. Bavido
* \#19. Schwan
* \#20. Brown

This leaves us with items 11, 12, 21 and 22 still unaddressed. We'll take time
to look at those in our "Chapter One Extra Day."

Remember that the first weekly written assignment is due on Tuesday at 4pm.

Have a good long weekend. Expect a message from me when the section on matrices
is up. (Likely in the next 12 hours.) Drop me a message if you want to talk
math over the weekend.
