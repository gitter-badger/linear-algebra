We discussed a few key things today. I think I am most glad we had the talk about
how you can design a matrix to achieve a certain effect as a mapping if you
know what should happen to the vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$.

Here is the run down of events:

  * \#2.7 McGee
  * \#2.9 Bostian
  * \#2.10 Smits
  * \#2.21 Spurgeon
  * \#2.22 Ratz
  * \#2.23 Doore
  * \#2.24 Doore

As a class, you have solved and discussed all of the tasks I have set for you
except for 2.6, 2.11 and 2.16. In ten meetings, you have plowed through nearly
60 challenges.

Keep in mind the big picture: we are learning several mental models for how to
think about vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations. In the long run,
it is those models which will help you solve problems using linear algebra
effectively.
