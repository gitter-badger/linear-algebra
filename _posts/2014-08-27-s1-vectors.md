We got off to a good start today. Here is my record of proceedings, labeled by
the exercise number.

1. Bostian
2. Kos
3. Smits
4. Fangman
5. Spurgeon
6. Sorensen
7. Nelson
8. Mathis
9. Ratz
10. McGee

I especially liked seeing multiple solutions to a few of these, and I was glad
we got to talk about the geometry of these things a bit.

I will drop another note when the tasks for section 1.2 are up.
