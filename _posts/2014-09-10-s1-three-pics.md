We focused on the three different mental models one can make for linear algebra, today.
I am really glad we got to start the conversation about the way a matrix can define
a function. This is challenging for new learners of linear algebra, and we will
talk about this many more times, I am sure.

Here is what got finished today:

  * \#2.1 Ratz
  * \#2.2 Smits
  * \#2.3 Bavido
  * \#2.4 Sorensen
  * \#2.5 Bostian
  * \#2.7 Becker

Please note that the numbers are off in the workbook. I will fix that shortly, I
hope. The numbers above are the "corrected" ones.

The next reading is about how to solve systems of equations carefully and
systematically, and involves lots of new vocabulary. It might be a good idea to
make yourself a little glossary.
