We had some good conversations today as we went through some of the items we had
not, yet, had a chance to discuss. In particular, I was pleased we got a chance to
talk a little about using the row picture and the column picture, and that we got
to talk a little about the inverse of a matrix coming from solving a system.

Here is a run-down of the presenters I have in my notes:

* \# 9 Cullen
* \# 20 Cullen
* \# 22 Nogueira
* \# 24 Kalishek
* \# 30 Leone

By my records, that means we haven't finished with 10-12, 19, 21, 25-28. Perhaps
we shall get a chance to discuss some of these if we have extra time on a day in
the future. But for now, we move ahead to Chapter 2.
