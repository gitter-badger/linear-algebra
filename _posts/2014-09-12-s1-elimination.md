Today we discussed the elimination method for solving systems
of linear equations. I think that our two most important
conversations were about (1) careful book-keeping for the
elimination method, and (2) some of the ways that three
planes in space can meet, and why this is connected to the
idea of solving systems anyway.

The run-down of what got presented:

  * \#2.8 Nelson
  * \#2.12 Ratz
  * \#2.13 Bostian
  * \#2.14 Fangman
  * \#2.15 Becker

  Again, the numbers were off in the workbook for this meeting.
  They have now been corrected, and so I have used the updated
  numbers here.
