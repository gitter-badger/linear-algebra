Today was a bit slow. We did get a chance to talk about following the process
of Gauss-Jordan elimination to compute the inverse of a square matrix. Remember
that it is an algorithm, and to be "standard" it has to be done a particular way:

1. Forward Pass -- eliminate below pivots
2. Backward Pass -- eliminate above pivots
3. Rescale

We also talked about the connection to matrix elimination as a way to see why
the funny process actually does what it says it does. And we explored doing the
process with Sage.

Today's presenters:

  * \#2.32 Kalishek
  * \#2.33 Nogueira
  * \#2.33 Takahashi

The next reading is about the \(LU\)-decomposition.
