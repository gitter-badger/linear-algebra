title: Permutations &amp; Matrix Multiplications
tags: section02
---

We had time to buzz through a bunch of neat things about matrix multiplication today.
The new key idea is to deal with row swaps by using permutation matrices. In fact,
permutation matrices help us deal with all sorts of _combinations_ of row swaps.
They are also our first examples of what we will call *orthogonal matrices*. We
haven't defined that word, yet, but it will turn up eventually.

  * \#2.47 Takahashi
  * \#2.48 Takahashi
  * \#2.50 Kalishek


The list of tasks we have not yet discussed is this:
In chapter two, workbook section 2.4: 30,
In chapter two, workbook section 2.5: 35-38,
In chapter two, workbook section 2.7: 49, 51 (we started...)

That is only seven items, so I don't see why we can't discuss them all on Monday.
