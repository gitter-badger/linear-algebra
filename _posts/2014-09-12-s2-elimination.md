Today we discussed the elimination method for solving systems
of linear equations. We had an important conversation about
careful book-keeping for the elimination method. We also
spent a little more time connecting the algebra of systems
to the different pictures.

The run-down of what got presented:

  * \#2.8 Cullen and Teske
  * \#2.10 Nogueira
  * \#2.11 Takahashi
  * \#2.12 Van Nevele
  * \#2.13 Leone

  Again, the numbers were off in the workbook for this meeting.
  They have now been corrected, and so I have used the updated
  numbers here.
