Title: Exam Day One
tags: section01, section02
---

Today was the first exam.

Remember, no panic is allowed. We are all trying out this new assessment
system together. (I know, it is my fault.) But the idea is to focus on
_learning_. What does the exam show we know how to do? What does it show
we need to work on? Well, I hope to return them soon so we can talk it through.
Those things that need more work will have to be reassessed. We will talk about
that more in the coming days.

You have been working hard the last five weeks, and it shows.

Now, take a short breather, and then go read the workbook section 3.1. It is up
and waiting for you.
