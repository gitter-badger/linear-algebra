Well, that was fun to watch. You all did all of the work, pretty much spot on,
and you asked good questions. We saw stuff done by hand, stuff done with Sage,
and lots of good explanations. I could not be happier.

I was glad we got a chance to talk about how the \\(LU\\) decomposition is useful
in practice, too.

Here is the run-down on presenters:

  * \#2.39 Sorenson
  * \#2.40 Helmold
  * \#2.41 Smits
  * \#2.42 Becker
  * \#2.43 Bostian
  * \#2.44 Doore
  * \#2.45 Banker

Good work! In our next meeting, we will discuss the idea of a _permutation matrix_
and how those kinds of matrices can help us understand a matrix factorization
when you absolutely cannot avoid a row swap operation during Gaussian Elimination.
