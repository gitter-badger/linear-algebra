Today's discussion hinged around finding ways to understand a matrix equation
\\[ A x = b. \\]
We ended up translating this kind of thing into either a system of equations or
a linear combination equation. Then we could use some geometric reasoning to
solve problems and make arguments.

Run down of what we discussed:

  * \#23. McDowell, then Van Nevele
  * \#26. Nogueira (though this didn't really finish)
  * \#29. Takahashi, and then Weber

That was as far as we got. I am beginning to be a little concerned about the
pacing in class. It is my hope that we all show up a little better prepared to
give presentations and ask questions.


On Friday we will go to the lab for class (WRT 112).
On Monday we will have a "catch up and review day." That will give us time to
discuss any items we missed, and to have any other discussion on questions you
have so far. For the record, these are the items we have not, yet, discussed:

> vectors: #9, 10, 11, 12; dot products: #19, 20, 21, 22;
> matrices: #24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30
