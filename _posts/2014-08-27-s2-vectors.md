We got off to a good start today. Here is my record of proceedings, labeled by
the exercise number.

1. Takahashi
2. Leone
3. Ohlendorf
4. Mossman
5. Leinen (with some discussion by Murphy, too.)
6. Kalishek
7. Cullen
8. Weber

Today seemed a bit "low-energy." Should I bring dance music?

I will drop another note when the tasks for section 1.2 are up.
