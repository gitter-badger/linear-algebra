We had several important conversations about the structure of matrix multiplication
today. It is helpful to remember that there are four reasonable ways to think
about matrix multiplication \\(A*B\\):

1. dot products, rows of \\(A\\) with columns of \\(B\\)
2. linear combinations of columns of \\(A\\)
3. linear combinations of rows of \\(B\\)
4. "outer products," columns of \\(A\\) with rows of \\(B\\).

Using one or the other of these ways of thinking might be the tool you need to
design your way out of a particular problem.

The run-down of today's presentations:

   * \#2.25 Ratz &amp; Nelson
   * \#2.26 Schwan
   * \#2.27 Spurgeon
   * \#2.29 Nelson
   * \#2.30 TJH
   * \#2.31 Class discussion.

Note that 31 is a key insight to what will be happening in the
reading for &sect; 2.6.
