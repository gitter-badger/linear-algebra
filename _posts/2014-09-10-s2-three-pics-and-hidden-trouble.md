We focused on two of the three different mental models one can make for
linear algebra, today. We will soon take up serious discussion of the third,
though it made a short appearance.

I was very glad to talk through some things I didn't even know were misconceptions.
This is a big reason I like this class structure. I might never know you had trouble
with some of these things until an exam. It was good to talk about what solving
a matrix equation really means, and about how to think about how what shape an equation
\\(2x -z =3\\) defines _depends on the space you are working in_.

Here is what got finished today:

  * \#2.1 Weber
  * \#2.2 Weber
  * \#2.3 Van Nevele
  * \#2.6 King, Bray, Leinen


Please note that the numbers are off in the workbook. I will fix that shortly, I
hope. The numbers above are the "corrected" ones.

The next reading is about how to solve systems of equations carefully and
systematically, and involves lots of new vocabulary. It might be a good idea to
make yourself a little glossary.
