We discussed a few key things today. I think I am most glad we had the talk about
how you can design a matrix to achieve a certain effect as a mapping if you
know what should happen to the vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. It was also satisfying
to get a complete list of all the ways you could arrange three planes in space.

Here is the run down of events:

  * \#2.5 Van Nevele
  * \#2.7 Weber
  * \#2.15 Bray
  * \#2.16 Weber &amp; Van Nevele
  * \#2.21 Teske
  * \#2.23 Teske
  * \#2.24 Teske

As a class, you have solved and discussed all of the tasks I have set for you
in this chapter except for 2.4, 2.9 and 2.14. In ten meetings, you have plowed through nearly
50 challenges.

Keep in mind the big picture: we are learning several mental models for how to
think about vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations. In the long run,
it is those models which will help you solve problems using linear algebra
effectively.
