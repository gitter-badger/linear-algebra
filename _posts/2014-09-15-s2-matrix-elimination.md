Another good day of conversations. We talked about permutation matrices and the
transpose; the "standard" form of forward pass elimination, and how to make elimination
work by using a matrix multiplication. Then we did a little discussion about Sage.

The activity from today:

  * \#2.17 Van Nevele
  * \#2.18 Leone
  * \#2.19 Johnson
  * \#2.20 Bray
  * \#2.22 Weber

  As I see it, the list of items we have not discussed, and so should be prepared
  for our next class meeting is as follows:
  Chapter 2 Tasks 4, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 21, 23, 24
