Hi all, 

You received this message because you are enrolled in my section of Linear Algebra for Spring 2014. I am busy getting things ready, including this mailing list!

If everything is set up correctly, this list will also get posted to a google groups message board, available at this address:

https://groups.google.com/a/uni.edu/forum/#!forum/math-2500-01-spring

I look forward to seeing you all on Monday.

Prof Hitchman
